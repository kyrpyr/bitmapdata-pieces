# Bitmap Data Pieces

A modern TypeScript/Vite port of an original ActionScript 3 particle bitmap experiment.

The project keeps the core AS3 behavior and adds quality-of-life improvements like runtime controls, presets, and tuning options.

Supports very high particle density with up to 640k particles on screen.
